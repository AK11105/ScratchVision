# ScratchVision

A comprehensive, modular project for learning and implementing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) from classical architectures to modern designs. This project serves as both a learning resource and a reference implementation for academic and professional purposes.

## ðŸ“š Project Overview

This repository is designed to guide learners through key milestones in CNN development, starting from **LeNet-5** and progressing through **AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet, EfficientNet, ConvNeXt**, and specialized architectures like **Capsule Networks**.  

The project emphasizes:
- **Hands-on implementation:** Build each architecture from scratch using PyTorch.
- **Modular design:** Easily experiment with models, datasets, and training routines.
- **Learning focus:** Understand the principles behind architectural innovations.
